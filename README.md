#### 1. About Node Version

Before you doing anything please make sure you have the correct version of **NODE** installed and the latest version of **PNPM**. Recommand to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage different versions of nodejs (and npm).

Node version should be 22.x (`22.14.0` recommended). You can run `nvm use` and nvm will pick the correct version for you automatically. In fact, it is highly recommended for the the command `nvm use` to be added to your shell rc file for you to automatically configure your node version between projects. [Refer to the instructions.](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file)
